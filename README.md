# PeterThePumpkin
The Arduino Uno code for Peter the Pumpkin (a paper mache head for Halloween), part of my entry into the Farnell Element14 ShareTheScare competition 2018.

The pumpkin is fitted out with a pair of servo eyes, a WS2812 RGB LED strip, a stepper motor turntable and a PIR detector to sense movement.
